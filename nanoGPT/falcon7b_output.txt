The following is what is given in ‘The Tempest’:
The Tempest
ACT I
A barren and rocky isle, in the West Indies
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL: Come, ho, you winds, blow up
and make your mistress ready for the sea.
Sound the Trumpet
Enter SEBASTIAN, with the MALLETS
SEBASTIAN
Ay, and I will.
I'll to the Duke with the report, how I have heard
Ariel, the King's jester, and the Duke's fool.
Enter the DUKE and PROPHET
DUKE:
And I have been most royally entertained.
The spirit of this place
Will not endure the yoke of the common law.
Proph.:
The spirit of this island
Will bear no yoke of the common laws.
I'll not endure
Any of my subjects that shall be my jester.
I'll hang thee at the heels and kick thee in the teeth,
For I'll make thee the butt o' every jester.
I do defy the King's jester, and his tricks;
And here's the buttock for thee. Come hither.
Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN:
My master bids you come to him.
ARIEL:
Ay, and so do I; and I'll to him, too.
SEBASTIAN:
He hath made you a little man, and calls for you.
ARIEL:
I'll be with him; but first, farewell.
SEBASTIAN:
And I with thee. I'll go before thee;
My mistress hath a tongue in her head.
ARIEL:
I'll to him. Come, ho, you winds,
You must awake again.
PROPHET:
I am awake, my lord,
And I have been these many hours.
ARIEL:
Then you know not yet the day;
Nor what the day, nor when the time is.
PROPHET:
I have told thee that I know not;
Therefore, I know not.
ARIEL:
And what I say to you is true.
If you be not awake to-morrow morning,
You'll know the truth of what I say to you.
Exit
PROPHET:
He hath given me a task I cannot do.
I cannot make a bed to-morrow morning;
For I have slept upon the sand already;
And that's as hard as any bed of straw.
But come what come may, I'll do it still.
Enter ariel
ARIEL:
Good morrow, sir.
PROPHET:
Good morrow, my good jester.
ARIEL: Good morrow, good sir.
PROPHET:
How does the King?
ARIEL: How does the Duke?
PROPHET:
As well as you would have him.
ARIEL: As well as you would have me.
PROPHET:
I have been thinking of the King's words.
ARIEL:
Ay, and so have I; and the Duke's words;
And I know you have; and therefore, I know you have not.
PROPHET:
I think the King loves me better than the Duke.
ARIEL:
The King loves you best, for the Duke loves not at all.
PROPHET:
I'll not be so sure of that as thou.
ARIEL:
Nay, but I say the Duke loves the King no more nor less
Than loves himself a little. For he loves himself
So much that he'll go to the King's wedding-feast,
And then he'll say to the King, 'How much I love thee,'
And then he'll kiss the King, and say, ''Tis not true.
And then he'll tell the King a lie. And the King,
Being a very honest gentleman,
Will believe all he says, and so they'll be friends.
PROPHET:
I'll not believe thee for all that.
ARIEL:
Nay, but I tell you.
PROPHET:
I tell thee thou liest.
ARIEL:
Nay, I do tell thee the truth:
And therefore do thou love me better than the Duke.
PROPHET:
No, I'll love him better than thy jester, though thou be
The son of a noble father.
ARIEL:
I have heard
That you are noble-hearted, sir.
PROPHET:
So have I.
ARIEL:
I'd have you to my jester.
PROPHET:
I have heard, sir, that you were the jester of the Queen,
And she loved you for your wit.
ARIEL:
I'll love thee better than I loved her,
And that's more than I have done;
So will I make thee my jester.
PROPHET:
I'll be your jester.
ARIEL:
I will.
PROPHET:
I will, for thy love.
ARIEL:
I love thee better than I loved my mistress.
PROPHET:
I love thee better than thou didst her.
ARIEL:
I love you better than I ever loved my mistress, and
I loved my mistress passing dear. And therefore
I'll make you the jester to my lord.
PROPHET:
You will?
You are my jester.
Enter ariel a second time
ARIEL:
Ay, but not so good a one as my first jester.
PROPHET:
I was the jester of the Queen, and I am
The jest of your lord.
ARIEL:
And I am the jester to my lord, and therefore
You must to my lord; and I must leave you.
PROPHET:
I'll leave thee, and I'll go to my lord.
ARIEL:
And I'll leave thee to go to my lord.
PROPHET:
And I'll leave thee to my lord.
ARIEL:
Nay, you'll not leave me till you have been the jester
To my lord, and have seen him merry. Therefore,
To the King! and I to thee.
PROPHET:
And I to thee, my lord, and to the King!
Exeunt both
